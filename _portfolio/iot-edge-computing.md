## Project Overview

Developed an innovative IoT edge computing platform that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it's needed, improving response times and saving bandwidth. The platform enables real-time data processing, machine learning at the edge, and seamless cloud integration.

## Key Features

- **Edge Computing**: Local data processing on IoT devices to reduce latency
- **Machine Learning**: On-device inference using TensorFlow Lite
- **Real-time Analytics**: Process and analyze sensor data in real-time
- **Device Management**: Remote monitoring and management of IoT devices
- **Data Synchronization**: Bi-directional data sync between edge and cloud
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and secure device authentication
- **Scalability**: Support for thousands of connected devices

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Various Sensors
- **Edge Computing**: Python, TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV
- **Communication**: MQTT, WebSockets, HTTP/2
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS IoT Core, AWS Greengrass
- **Data Storage**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes (k3s)
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus
- **Security**: TLS/SSL, OAuth 2.0

## Results

- Reduced latency by 90% through edge processing
- Decreased bandwidth usage by 75% with local data processing
- Enabled real-time decision making at the edge
- Improved system reliability with offline capabilities
- Successfully deployed in industrial and smart home environments
